Brick-Breaker Proposal

Goal:
The suggested game is a brick-breaking game that includes bouncing a ball off a paddle to
shatter bricks. The aim of the game is to remove every brick from a level in order to score
points. To stop the ball from slipping off the screen, the player will use the left and right
arrow keys to move the paddle. The player will have three lives to clear every block on a
level in the game. If the player exhausts their life or removes every brick in the level, the
game will finish.

Game Mechanics:
A ball, a paddle, bricks, and power-ups will be part of the game's mechanics. Bricks will be
broken when the ball bounces off the paddle. To prevent the ball from bouncing off the
screen, the paddle will swivel horizontally. The bricks will be placed in rows and columns,
and when the ball strikes them, it will cause the bricks to crumble. To go on to the next level,
the player must remove every brick from a level.
In addition to breaking bricks and earning points, power-ups will appear during the game,
providing players with temporary advantages such as larger paddle size, multiple balls, or
increased ball speed. These power-ups will add an extra layer of excitement and challenge
to the gameplay. The game could have additional features such as a death brick where
hitting it ends the game and requires starting from the beginning of the current level.

Feedback:
The player will receive feedback from the game on their current level, score and remaining
lives. When the player destroys the bricks, the score rises, and as the ball leaves the
screen, the remaining life is depleted each time. After the player uses up all of their lives or
removes every brick on every level, the game will finish.
